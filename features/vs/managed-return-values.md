# Managed Return Values

Managed Return Values allow you to examine the result of a function call without having to assign the function result to a local variable. This is especially useful when the returned value is not stored in a local variable.      

Return value(s) get displayed in the "Autos Windows" (Debug->Windows->Autos). You can also use the pseudo variable "$ReturnValue" in the Watch and/or Immediate window to fetch the last functionâ€™s return value.
