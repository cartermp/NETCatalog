# Edit and Continue

Edit and Continue is a time-saving feature that enables you to make changes to your source code while your program is in break mode. When you resume execution of the program by choosing an execution command like *Continue* or *Step*, Edit and Continue automatically applies the code changes. This allows you to make changes to your code during a debugging session, instead of having to stop, recompile your entire program, and restart the debugging session.

Edit and Continue was initially only supported for 32-bit processes. It currently supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processes.
