# WinRT API Capabilities

Windows Runtime, or WinRT, is a platform-homogeneous application architecture first introduced in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 in 2012. WinRT supports development in C++/CX (Component Extensions, a language based on C++) and the managed code languages C# and VB.NET, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript. WinRT applications natively support both the x86 and ARM architectures, and also run inside a sandboxed environment to allow for greater security and stability.   WinRT components are designed with interoperability between multiple languages and APIs in mind, including native, managed and scripting languages.

Universal Windows Applications are built atop both WinRT and .NET Core, allowing you to take advantage of the amazing capabilities of both!
