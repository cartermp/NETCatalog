# Lambdas

A lambda expression is an anonymous function that can contain expressions and statements, and can be used to create delegates or expression tree types.

All lambda expressions use the lambda operator `=>`, which is read as *goes to*. The left side of the lambda operator specifies the input parameters (if any) and the right side holds the expression or statement block. The lambda expression `x => x * x` is read *x goes to x times x*.

The `=>` operator has the same precedence as assignment (`=`) and is right-associative.

Lambdas are used in method-based LINQ queries as arguments to standard query operator methods such as Where.

When you use method-based syntax to call the Where method in the Enumerable class (as you do in LINQ to Objects and LINQ to XML) the parameter is a delegate type `System.Func<T, TResult>`. A lambda expression is the most convenient way to create that delegate. When you call the same method in, for example, the System.Linq.Queryable class (as you do in LINQ to SQL) then the parameter type is an `System.Linq.Expressions.Expression<Func>` where Func is any Func delegates with up to sixteen input parameters. Again, a lambda expression is just a very concise way to construct that expression tree. The lambdas allow the Where calls to look similar although in fact the type of object created from the lambda is different.

A lambda expression with an expression on the right side is called an expression lambda. Expression lambdas are used extensively in the construction of Expression Trees. A statement lambda resembles an expression lambda except that the statement(s) is enclosed in braces like this: `(input parameters) => {statement;}`. Statement lambdas, like anonymous methods, cannot be used to create expression trees.

When writing lambdas, you often do not have to specify a type for the input parameters because the compiler can infer the type based on the lambda body, the underlying delegate type, and other factors as described in the C# Language Specification. For most of the standard query operators, the first input is the type of the elements in the source sequence.
