# NuGet Package Manager

NuGet is the package manager for the .NET platform.  It is free and open source.  NuGet client tools allow you to consume and produce packages for distribution.  With .NET Core, NuGet plays a pivotal role in resolving dependencies because of the package-first nature of .NET Core.  NuGet also contains the NuGet Gallery, which is a central package repository used by all authors and consumers of packages.

Finally, NuGet is also a first-class feature in Visual Studio.  Although there are excellent command-line tools for interacting with NuGet, the experience in Visual Studio is unparalleled.
