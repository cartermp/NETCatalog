# Reflection

"Mirror, mirror, on the wall. Which members of this object can I call?"

Reflection is one of the more dynamic features of .NET. It enables many key scenarios that would not be possible without it. There are two main aspects of and APIs for Reflection: inspection and invocation. Inspection (sometimes called introspection) enables a program to ask questions about  parts of or extensions to a program. The most typical questions are about asking whether a given class implements a certain interface or base class.

Invocation enables a program to call methods that it has found via the inspection APIs. They can also be used to interact with running code, to determine the value of a property or field. It is very common to use the invocation APIs to instantiate a class. A program can call arbitrary methods on the class, also by using the Reflection invocation APIs, or by casting to a concrete type that the instance supports.

Reflection.Emit is a separate API that enables a program to generate code at runtime. It is an analog to the JavaScript "eval" keyword. The Reflection.Emit takes MSIL byte code as input, not C# or other high-level .NET languages. The API generates machine code from the input byte code, similarly to if it was read from a .NET DLL file.
