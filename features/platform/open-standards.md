# .NET is an open standard

The .NET platform is based on open standards.

There was a very early realization by the founders of .NET that they were creating a new programming technology that had broad applicability across operating systems and CPU types and that advanced the state of the art of late 1990s (when the .NET project started at Microsoft) programming language implementation techniques. This led to considering and then pursuing standardization as an important pillar of establishing .NET in the industry.

The key addition to the state of the art was support for multiple programming languages with a single language runtime, hence the name Common Language Runtime. There were many other smaller additions, such as value types, a simple exception model and attributes. Generics and language integrated query were later added to that list.

Looking back, standardization was quite effective, leading to .NET having a strong presence on iOS and Android, with the Unity and Xamarin offerings, both of which use the Mono runtime. The same may end up being true for .NET on Linux.

The various .NET standards have been made meaningful by the collaboration of multiple companies and industry experts that have served on the working groups that have defined the standards. In addition (and most importantly), the .NET standards have been implemented by multiple commercial (ex: Unity IL2CPP, .NET Native) and open source (ex: Mono) implementors. The presence of multiple implementations proves the point of standardization.

.NET is based on the following ECMA standards:

ECMA 334 - C#
ECMA 335 - CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
ECMA 372 - C++/CLI
