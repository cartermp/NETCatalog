# Await and Async

The complex act of turning your code inside out to make it asynchronous is over! The new async and await keywords do the magic for you allowing you to write easy to read async code that looks almost exactly like the synchronous version.

* **Client UI Code** - Easy to write client UI code that doesn't block
* **Business logic** - Easy to write code that fetches data from multiple sources in parallel
* **Server code** - Better scalability -- no need to have a thread per request.
* **New APIs** in BCL, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, WCF, XML, WPF make it even easier!
