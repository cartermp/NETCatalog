# P/Invoke

"Platform invoke" or P/Invoke is a runtime-provided service that enables managed code to call native functions that are in dlls, including Win32 APIs. It locates and invokes an exported function and marshals its arguments. To call a method that is exported from a dll, it must be marked with DllImport. Default or custom marshaling can be used. 

For every .NET Framework type there is a default native type, which the common language runtime will use to marshal data across the managed/unmanaged boundary, to satisfy a function call. For example, the default marshaling for C# string values is to the type LPTSTR (pointer to TCHAR char buffer). You can override the default marshaling using the MarshalAs attribute in the  declaration of the native function. Callback methods can also be registered. To register a managed callback that calls a native function, declare a delegate with the same argument list and pass an instance of it via P/Invoke. .NET delegates appear to native code as function pointers.
