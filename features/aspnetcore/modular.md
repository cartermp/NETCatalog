# Modular from the bottom up

ASP.NET Core is a modular web framework.  At its core, it is essentially a console application that reads and writes data from and to ports.  That's it!  Middleware and dependency injection are the two models used for layering everything great about ASP.NET MVC, logging, security, and other features atop this lean core.  Each of these pieces are delivered via NuGet packages that you can include as needed.  Additionally, ASP.NET Core is based on .NET Core.

.NET Core is a modular set of runtime, library, and compiler components.  You can compose them in various configurations to match your workloads.  With NuGet as a vehicle for delivering  libraries, you can pull in a lean .NET Standard Library to have a low footprtint for your code.

But let's take that a step further.  With ASP.NET Core, .NET Core, and the .NET Standard Library, we've introduced a set of organized packages guaranteed to be compatible with any consumers of the .NET Standard Library.  But what if you wanted to be even more compatible?  With the ability to "trim" your .NET Standard Library dependencies such that you depend *only* the packages your code actually uses, you can write code that has an even greater reach than ever before.

This increased flexibility, in tandem with the extent of .NET Core's cross-platform reach and Xamarin, can allow your code to be used almost anywhere in almost any scenario.
