# Cross Platform

.NET Core is cross-platform, allowing you to write ASP.NET code that will run on various Linux distributions, OS X, and Windows.  Additionally, ASP.NET Core can run on different CPU architectures.

Consider the following scenario:

Imagine you wish to build an analytics system with mobile, web, and Windows clients.  You might have your system split into multiple services, potentially with different databases for different kinds of data.  You might also wish to host your web client and various APIs to each service on any OS, potentially in containers.  You might want to have a Continueous Integration (CI) system in place that builds on one OS and redirects each built assembly to different servers to run tests.

That's quite a lot of flexibility, isn't it?  We want you to have that sort of flexibility.  ASP.NET Core being cross-platform offers that.
