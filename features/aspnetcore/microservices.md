# Optimized for Microservices and the Cloud

ASP.NET Core is optimized for Microservices and the Cloud.  But what on earth does that even mean?

With modularity at its core and performance being a first-class citizen, ASP.NET Core is up to the task for being able to service as many requests as you can throw at it while having the smallest possible footprint on a machine.  Additionally, by being cross-platform, you can put your microservices in any cloud you want (but you should probably pick Azure ... just sayin').
