# Xamarin.Forms

Build native UIs for iOS, Android and Windows from a single, shared >NET codebase. If you know C#, you already know how to build iOS, Android, and Windows apps.

1. Author your UI in .NET or XAML. Xamarin.Forms pages represent single screens within an app. Pages contain advanced gesture support and layouts, buttons, labels, lists, and other common controls. Connect these controls to shared backend code and you get fully native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps built entirely with shared .NET.

2. At runtime, each page and its controls are mapped to platform-specific native user interface elements; for example, a Xamarin.Forms Entry becomes a UITextView on iOS, an EditText on Android, and a TextBox on Windows.

## Take full advantage of each platform

**Create custom views.**

Create platform-specific views built with Xamarin.iOS or Xamarin.Android to customize the user interface on each platform.

**Call platform APIs via shared services.**

Need device-level functionality? Use Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android or use Xamarin.Forms services that abstract platform-specific APIs.

**Choose markup or code.**

Use code or markup to build a beautiful UI with data-binding and styles, using either .NET or XAML markup.
