# Native Cross-Platform iOS, OS X, Android, and Windows Mobile

Xamarin allows you to seliver native Android, iOS, and
Windows apps, using existing skills,
teams, and code.

## Xamarin apps look and feel native because they are

***Native User Interfaces.***

Xamarin apps are built with standard, native user interface controls. Apps not only look the way the end user expects, they behave that way too.

**Native API Access.**

Xamarin apps have access to the full spectrum of functionality exposed by the underlying platform and device, including platform-specific capabilities like iBeacons and Android Fragments.

**Native Performance.**

Xamarin apps leverage platform-specific hardware acceleration, and are compiled for native performance. This canâ€™t be achieved with solutions that interpret code at runtime.
