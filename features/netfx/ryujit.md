# RyuJIT Next Generation JIT #

RyuJIT is the code name for the modern unified CLR JIT compiler that helps drive innovation faster, improve throughput, and improve code quality while providing consistent, predictable performance across architectures.  While consistency across architectures is driven by using a single code base, substantial investments in modernizing the compiler enables powerful optimizations  (e.g., SSA based Value Numbering) while dramatically improving the throughput.  RyuJIT is also the enabler for the new BCL SIMD types â€“ providing access to SIMD hardware with .NET managed types.  RyuJIT has been made available to customers through 4 CTP releases, with some great feedback, and we are continuing to incorporate customer feedback.  Get the latest [RyuJIT update](http://aka.ms/RyuJIT), and read more on the [.NET Framework blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/). RyuJIT is helping us bring up support for a new architecture with greater agility, and promises the same agility for future innovation.

Code generation terms explained:

- Throughput: How fast does the compiler generate code.
- Code quality: How fast does the generated code execute.
- Consistency: How does the generated code differ across architectures. 
- Predictability: How do throughput/code quality vary with different inputs to the compiler.
