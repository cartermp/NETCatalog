# ClickOnce

ClickOnce is a deployment technology that allows you to create self-updating Windows-based applications that can be installed and run with minimal user interaction. ClickOnce delivers three major features:

* **Low-friction installation:** ClickOnce deployment allows non-administrative users to install  applications.
* **Low-impact installation:** ClickOnce deployment treats each application as a self-contained unit, with the effect that ClickOnce installation does not affect other applications.
* **Ease of updating applications:** ClickOnce deployment allows you to provide updates to users automatically. It is easy to update all users to the new version of an application.

Windows client deployment challenges have caused many developers to create Web applications rather than client applications, sacrificing rich Windows user interface, responsiveness, offline capabilities and integration with native Windows APIs (ex: COM, Win32). ClickOnce delivers a Windows client deployment solution that shares characteristics with Web applications, while not giving up on any of the richness of Windows.
