# Windows Forms

Windows Forms is the first client app API that was included in .NET. It remains quite popular. It is effectively a wrapper API over the Windows GDI+ API. Windows forms enables developers to build graphically rich client applications, that enable both network-connected and offline scenarios and that are easy to deploy and update. 

Windows Forms applications are sometimes deployed with the ClickOnce deployment technology, which supports both intranet and internet deployment. ClickOnce was introduced in the .NET Framework 2.0.
