# Multicore JIT

Multi-core JIT improves the performance of apps by Just-In-Time (JIT) compiling IL code on multiple cores. By default, the JIT compiles code on the same core that code is executing on, and the app must wait for that execution to complete, one method at a time. Multi-core JIT is intended to compile code faster than an app can execute code, such that the JIT gets ahead of app execution, allowing the app to execute without waiting for the JIT.

The JIT determines the most optimum order to compile methods in the app, based on profile data collected from previous runs of the app. This information enables the JIT to compile app code before it is needed, while not slowing down the app. Once the JIT has completed compiling all of the methods recorded in the profile data, multi-core JIT disables itself, returning to regular single-core mode.

Multi-Core JIT typically has the most significant benefit to startup time. It's typically the most critical user experience for performance. You can record any aspect of your app experience in a profile. It might be the case that you record startup and then another part of your app than can have perf hicups without Multi-Core JIT.

You'll need to enable multi-core JIT to turn it on. If you're using Silverlight 5 or ASP.NET, multi-core JIT has already been turned on for you.
