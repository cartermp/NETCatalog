# Windows Presentation Foundation

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a presentation system for building Windows client applications with visually stunning user experiences. The core of WPF is a resolution-independent and vector-based rendering engine that is built to take advantage of modern graphics hardware. WPF extends the core with a comprehensive set of application-development features that include the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), controls, data binding, layout, 2-D and 3-D graphics, animation, styles, templates, documents, media, text, and typography. WPF is included in the .NET Framework, so you can build applications that incorporate other elements of the .NET Framework class library.

Most WPF programming is familiar for a .NET developer. To support some of the more powerful WPF capabilities and to simplify the programming experience, WPF includes additional programming constructs that enhance properties and events: dependency properties and routed events.

WPF offers additional programming enhancements for Windows client application development. One obvious enhancement is the ability to develop an application using both markup and code-behind, an experience that ASP.NET developers should be familiar with. You generally use Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) markup to implement the appearance of an application while using managed programming languages (code-behind) to implement its behavior.

The code-behind approach has strengths and weaknesses. The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern was developed to mitigate the weaknesses experienced with code-behind. To many people, XAML and MVVM have become inseparable concepts.

XAML was first introduced with WPF. It has been since used in other Microsoft programming models, specifically Silverlight and Windows Store. Xamarin uses a variant of Microsoft XAML for its Xamarin.Forms product, which supports iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms.
