# ASP.NET Web Forms

ASP.NET Web Forms is a way to build web applications with XAML, offering you the ability to transfer your familarity with WPF and WinForms to the web.  ASP.NET Web Forms lets you build dynamic websites using a familiar drag-and-drop, event-driven model. A design surface and hundreds of controls and components let you rapidly build sophisticated, powerful UI-driven sites with data access.

**ASP.NET Web Forms are:**

* Based on Microsoft ASP.NET technology, in which code that runs on the server dynamically generates Web page output to the browser or client device.
* Compatible with any browser or mobile device. An ASP.NET Web page automatically renders the correct browser-compliant HTML for features such as styles, layout, and so on.
* Compatible with any language supported by the .NET common language runtime, such as Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft Visual C#.
* Built on the Microsoft .NET Framework. This provides all the benefits of the framework, including a managed environment, type safety, and inheritance.
* Flexible because you can add user-created and third party controls to them.

**ASP.NET Web Forms offer:**

* Separation of HTML and other UI code from application logic.
* A rich suite of server controls for common tasks, including data access.
* Powerful data binding, with great tool support.
* Support for client-side scripting that executes in the browser.
* Support for a variety of other capabilities, including routing, security, performance, internationalization, testing, debugging, error handling and state management.
